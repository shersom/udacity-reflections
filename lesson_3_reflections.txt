1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    If you are collaborating with more people outside of your local network,
    it would be vital for you to have a networked repository. You also may
    just want to have things in the cloud for safe keeping.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It seems like there might be times where you version of things is not
    quite ready to merge in changes from a remote. You might want to make
    what you are working on into a branch, leaving the main part clean and
    ready to be updated by changes coming from the remote.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

    A fork is GitHub specific type of clone (probably). It does a GitHub to
    GitHub clone of a repository while keeping track of various metadata: a
    link to the original, how many times that original has been cloned, and
    probably some other things. Clones are just as they sound a clone of at
    least one branch of a repository containing everything in the original
    at the time of cloning. Git will create a remote to whatever was cloned.
    A branch is created locally and is maintained within a repository by the
    repository owner. Forks and clones are not. Use forks and clones when
    you want to experiment with others stuff; use branches when it's your
    own.
