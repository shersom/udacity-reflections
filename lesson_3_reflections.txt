1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    If you are collaborating with more people outside of your local network,
    it would be vital for you to have a networked repository. You also may
    just want to have things in the cloud for safe keeping.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It seems like there might be times where you version of things is not
    quite ready to merge in changes from a remote. You might want to make
    what you are working on into a branch, leaving the main part clean and
    ready to be updated by changes coming from the remote.
